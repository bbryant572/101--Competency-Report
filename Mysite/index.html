        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>Hello! I am junior software developer. I served 13 years honorably in the U.S. Navy. I currently live abroad with my partner of seven years in Costa Rica. I have a 11 year old black lab and two cats. Their names are Riley, Loki, and Ruca. 
            After leaving the military, my partner and I traveled the United States in a schoolie (a school bus transformed into a tiny home.) Sadly, our bus broke down, but when life gives you lemons you move to Costa Rica! Transitioning from the U.S. to an another country certainly took some time to adjust. While in Costa Rica, the pandemic happened. Given this time to work on myself, reflect, and gain more skills, I decided to go back to school for full-stack web development. I needed a new challenge and software development was just what I needed! So, if you are viewing this page then you need some assistance and I am more than happy to help! Please feel free to look at the services page to see what I offer and click the button below for contact info. Thanks and Pura Vida!
